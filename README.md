<br />
<h3 align="center">Communication</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Agent John sees this ticket was given a normal priority, but given the level of business impact, he goes in to edit the ticket as a Sev-A emergency ticket and reassign it to a System Administrator. He makes sure to leave a proper message to systems administrator Jane Doe.

<h3 align="center">Communication</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Agent John sees this is Sev-A emergency ticket and has to reassign ticket to a System Administrator.

<br />
<p>
  System Administrator agent Jane Doe logs in:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  Agent Jane works the issue and communicates back to agent John.
</p>
<p>
  She also makes sure to switch the status of the issue from open to resolved:

  </p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Resolution</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Support agent John sees in his portal that System Administrator agent Jane has left him a message and that the ticket is now closed:>

  </p>
<br />
<br />
<p>
  And now we have completed a simple scenario of the creation of a ticket by a user, assignment and communication of a ticket between agents, and ultimately it's resolution.
